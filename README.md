# AI Final Project

[Breast Cancer DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data#data.csv)

## Abstract
In this project, I am using a dataset from Kaggle (link provided above). Data set provides with informative feautures that are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. 
With the 30 features provided from the dataset I am splliting the first 400 rows for the training dataset and the remaining rows are used to test our model. The goal of the project is to create as an accurate model as we can that will predict if the diagnosed client will have a Benign or Malignant (cancerous) tumor.
